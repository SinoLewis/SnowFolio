      <description>Typescript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static type checking and other features to the language. In my portfolio projects, Typescript was used as the Node runtime with type support.
Benefits By using Typescript, I was able to catch type errors at compile-time rather than at runtime, which improved the quality and reliability of the code. It also made it easier to maintain the codebase over time by making it more self-documenting and easier to understand.</description>

      <description>Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework that is designed to help developers build user interfaces more efficiently and effectively. In my portfolio projects, Vue was used as the primary framework for building complex, responsive, and interactive web applications.
Benefits By using Vue, I was able to take advantage of its powerful features, including reactive data binding, component-based architecture, and the virtual DOM. This enabled me to create highly modular and reusable code, which made it easier to develop and maintain the applications over time.</description>
