Golang is a programming language that is becoming increasingly popular for its simplicity, speed, and concurrency. In my portfolio projects, I have used Golang to deploy RESTful servers and plan to explore tRPC servers.

## Golang in Portfolio Projects

Here are some examples of how I have incorporated Golang into my portfolio projects:

## Online Shop with Delivery

In this project, I used Golang to develop a RESTful server that powers an online shop. This server handles all the business logic for the online shop, including product listings, order management, and payment processing. Golang's simplicity and concurrency features made it a great fit for this project, allowing me to easily handle high levels of traffic and complex business logic.

## Admin Dashboard as Site Monitor

In this project, I used Golang to develop a RESTful server that powers an admin dashboard. This server monitors various metrics related to website performance, such as server response times, website uptime, and page load times. Golang's speed and simplicity were crucial in this project, allowing me to easily perform complex calculations and generate reports in real-time.

## Benefits

The incorporation of Golang into portfolio projects offers several benefits, including:

1. High performance and concurrency capabilities, making it ideal for handling high levels of traffic and complex business logic
1. Simple and easy-to-read syntax, reducing the likelihood of bugs and errors
1. Large and growing community, providing access to a wealth of resources and support

## Conclusion

Golang is a powerful and versatile programming language that I have used extensively in my portfolio projects. Whether I am building an online shop or an admin dashboard, Golang's speed and simplicity make it an excellent choice for deploying RESTful servers. As I continue to explore new opportunities in software development, I am excited to explore Golang's capabilities further, including the development of tRPC servers.
