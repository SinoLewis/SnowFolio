description: Strict syntactical superset of JavaScript 
---

Typescript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static type checking and other features to the language. In my portfolio projects, Typescript was used as the Node runtime with type support.

## Benefits

By using Typescript, I was able to catch type errors at compile-time rather than at runtime, which improved the quality and reliability of the code. It also made it easier to maintain the codebase over time by making it more self-documenting and easier to understand.

Typescript also helped me to improve the performance of my code by enabling better optimization and minimizing the amount of runtime type-checking that needed to be performed.

## Conclusion

Overall, Typescript is a powerful tool that helps to improve the quality and reliability of code by adding optional static type checking and other features to the JavaScript language. By using Typescript as the Node runtime with type support in my portfolio projects, I was able to create applications that were more efficient, reliable, and easier to maintain over time.
