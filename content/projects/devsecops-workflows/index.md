## Overview

The Dev-Sec-Ops Workflows project is a comprehensive guide to integrating security into the software development lifecycle. This project outlines the necessary steps and processes to ensure that security is embedded into every stage of the development process, from design to deployment.

The project covers a range of topics related to Dev-Sec-Ops, including vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, secure coding practices, and security testing. By following the guidelines outlined in this project, developers can ensure that security is an integral part of their software development process, reducing the risk of security breaches and vulnerabilities.

## Features

1. **Integration of Security** into Development Process: The project outlines a comprehensive approach to integrating security into the software development lifecycle, ensuring that security is considered at every stage of the process.

1. **Vulnerability Scanning and Threat Modeling:** The project covers vulnerability scanning and threat modeling, providing developers with the tools and techniques needed to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats.

1. **Secure Coding Practices:** The project provides guidelines for secure coding practices, including input validation, error handling, and access control, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities resulting from coding errors.

1. **Security Testing:** The project covers security testing techniques, including penetration testing and code reviews, ensuring that security is thoroughly tested before deployment.

Technologies Used
DevOps Tools: The project utilizes a range of DevOps tools, such as Jenkins, GitLab, and Ansible, to automate the software development process.

1. **Vulnerability Scanning Tools:** The project utilizes vulnerability scanning tools such as OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite, to identify potential security vulnerabilities.

1. **Threat Modeling Tools:** The project utilizes threat modeling tools such as Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, to identify potential security threats.

1. **Secure Coding Practices:** The project provides guidelines for secure coding practices, including input validation, error handling, and access control, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities resulting from coding errors.
